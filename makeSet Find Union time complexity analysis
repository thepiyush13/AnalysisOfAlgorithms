/*
Suppose  that  we  have  a  sequence  of  MakeSet-Find-Union  operations  in  which  no  Findappears before any Union.  What is the computational time for this sequence?
*/

In makeSet-Find-Union operation no Find appears before any Union:

Let us imagine n elements on which we are performing these operations
Let us see what individual operation does:
MakeSet - will create set of n elements 
Find - finds the element by traversing 
Union - connects edges 

for m operations on n elements : if it of format :
MakeSet    [Union    Union     Union     Union…….m-2]    Find

total no of times Union is run = m-2, length of total edge  = (m-2) *logn
total no of times MakeSet is run = 1 
thus before find runs the length of the edge  = k*logn (1<=k<=m)

total time taken by the Find 
= total length created by Union X total number of  operations
= k*logn 
= (m-2) *logn     //worst case
~m*logn

thus this represents the worst case for Union Find operation and the total time complexity for it will  
T(n) = O(mlogn)
