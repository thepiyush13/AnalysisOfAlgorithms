/*Give a formal proof that a 2-3 tree with n leaves has height bounded by log
2n */

By definition any 2-3 tree T of N elements:
2 <= child nodes at each node <= 3

Thus we can see that to find out the upper limit  on the height of such a 2-3 tree , we need to consider a tree having 2 child nodes at each node.

max height  of 2-3 tree T having at max 3 child nodes at each node  = H3
max height  of 2-3 tree T having at max 2 child nodes at each node  = H2

Total no of elements N at H3 = 3^H3
Total no of elements N at H2 = 2^H2

Thus N>=2^H2
so  H2<=logN             (base2)

Hence the Height of longest 2-3 tree will be less than or equal to logN( where N is the number of elements in the tree)
=> Upper bound in 2-3 Tree ~ logN
