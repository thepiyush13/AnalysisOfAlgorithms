# Analysis Of Algorithms
Algorithm design and analysis is a fundamental and important part of computer science. 
This repository contains advanced techniques for the design and analysis of algorithms, and explores a variety of applications.   
The topics and applications that coverd include greedy algorithms, network algorithms and network design, huffman codes and data compression, NP-hardness, approximation and randomized algorithms.
It Also contains various useful ideas, including randomization, probabilistic analysis, amortized analysis, competitive analysis, eigenvalues, linear and semi-definite programming, high dimensional geometry, and random walks.
