Write a pseudocode for kruskal's algo that solves minimum spanning tree problem.
Analyze the complexity(assume union-find-makeset operation takes O(logn) time).
Prove that algo works correctly.

Kruskal( e,v,w):
	//e is the edge. v the vertex and w in the adjacent vertex
	Set S 
	foreach vertex v in Graph G:
		makeSet(v)
	sort e by weight into non decreasing order 
	foreach edge vertex u connecting v in e
		if u and v are both on makeSet:
			S = S U {u,v}
		union(u,v)
return S	

Time complexity
ElogV OR ElogE as it is a connected graph
Proof: by contradiction
By induction if T is the tree from kruskal algorithm and T1 is the minimal spanning tree
e is the edge in T1 such that e is of minimum weight and not in T1
if we can form a cycle with e thus T becomes the minimum spanning tree 
we consider edge in sorted order 
e is crossing edge of minimum weight
algorithm is taking minimal-weight crossing edge
