Modify the quicksort algo so that the pivot is selected using the linear-time O(nlogn) in the worst case.
Discuss why this algo is not used in practice.

public int QUICKSORT(int[] inArray, int left, int right) {
    if (left<right) {
        int median=MEDIANFIND(inArray, len(inArray)/2 );
        QUICKSORT(inArray, left, median-1)
        QUICKSORT(inArray, median+1, right)
    }
}


MEDIANFIND: S,K
	if |S| <=20
	Groups G = S -> 5 element group -> median of each group
	Set D = G.MAKESET(n/5)
		m = MEDIANFIND(Sn/5,n/10)

The median-based quicksort is rarely used in practice because it tends
to have a larger constant than other quicksort implementations.
